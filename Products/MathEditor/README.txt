This Zope/Plone Product is used as part of the Rhaptos system (http://rhaptos.org),
created to run Connexions (http://cnx.org.)

Install through GenericSetup, or through standard QuickInstaller, which runs GenericSetup,
in any portal after installing the code in the standard (non-egg/buildout) manner for Products:
that is, put the directory in /Products. QuickInstaller is most useful in Rhaptos context,
because we cannot yet run all steps; QI runs only selected steps that are needed for this product.

Used mostly in Rhaptos contexts by its developers and maintainers, so report any
infelicities when used in standard Plone.
